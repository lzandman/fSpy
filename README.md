## What is this?

fSpy is an open source, cross platform app for still image camera matching. See [fspy.io](https://fspy.io) for more info. The source code is available under the GPL license.

## Backstory

Once upon a time I wrote BLAM, a [Blender](https://blender.org) add-on for still image camera calibration that, despite its clunky UI, has gained some popularity in the Blender community. fSpy is an attempt to bring BLAM's functionality to a wider audience in the form of a stand alone app.

## Using the computed camera parameters in other applications

In theory, camera parameters computed by fSpy could be used in any application that has a notion of a 3D camera and provides some way of setting the camera parameters. If you're a Blender user, have a look at the [offical fSpy importer add-on](https://github.com/stuffmatic/fSpy-Blender). If you're using an application without a dedicated importer, you may still be able to manually copy the camera parameters from fSpy.

Interested in writing an importer for your favorite application? Then the [fSpy project file format spec](https://github.com/stuffmatic/fSpy/blob/develop/project_file_format.md) is a good starting point.


## Building and running

The following instructions are for developers. If you just want to run the app, [download the latest executable for your platform](https://github.com/stuffmatic/fSpy/releases).

fSpy is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) using [Electron](https://electronjs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org). [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is recommended for a pleasant editing experience.

To install necessary dependencies, run

```
npm install
```

The `src` folder contains three subfolders: `main` and `gui`, containing code for the [Electron main and renderer processes](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-architecture) respectively, and `cli`, which contains a command-line interface for processing fSpy project files without the GUI. The main process includes a preload script (`src/main/preload.ts`) that bridges the renderer and main processes via IPC.

To run the app in development mode, run

```
npm start
```

This builds the main, preload, and GUI code, starts the webpack dev server, and launches Electron once the dev server is ready. Changes to GUI (renderer) code reload automatically.

⚠️ The build process lacks live reloading on main process code changes. Changes to `src/main` code require restarting `npm start` in order to show up in the app.


## Creating binaries for distribution

To create executables for distribution, run

```
npm run dist
```

which invokes [Electron builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder).

⚠️ The `npm run dist` script builds for macOS, Windows, and Linux (`-mwl`). Building for macOS requires running on macOS. To build only for the current platform, run `npm run dist-preview` instead (output in `dist/` without packaging).
